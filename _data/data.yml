    title: Who I am
    summary: |
      I am a research scientist in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.
      I have a particular interest in language processing at the sentence
      level and beyond. I have a strong focus on science replicability,
      experimental methodology, and statistical analysis. I am now working as a research associate in the 
      Caring Futures Institute at Flinders University in South Australia. I am currently working on a number of projects 
      in the research areas of childhood cognitive development, disability, and language processing. 
      
      My particular areas of experience/interest are:
      - electroencephalography
      - eye-tracking
      - transcranial magnetic stimulation
      - preprocessing neurophysiologial data in MNE-Python
      - mixed effects modeling and latent growth modeling in R
      - open science and open access
