    title: Who I am
    summary: |
      I am a research scientist in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.
      I have a particular interest in language processing at the sentence
      level and beyond. I have a strong focus on science replicability,
      experimental methodology, and statistical analysis. I recently submitted my PhD
      and am now working as a research associate in the Caring Futures Institute at Flinders University
      in South Australia. 
      
      My particular areas of experience/interest are:
      - electroencephalography
      - eye-tracking
      - transcranial magnetic stimulation
      - preprocessing neurophysiologial data in MNE-Python
      - mixed effects modeling and latent growth modeling in R
      - open science and open access

    - degree: PhD in Psychology (Cognitive Neuroscience)
      university: University of South Australia
      time: 2016 - 2020
      details: |
        My research investigated the functional neurobiology of human 
        language processing, using electroencephalography and non-invasive 
        brain stimulation.
